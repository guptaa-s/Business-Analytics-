This repo contains certificates for Business Analytics course.

This repository also contains a Project which I made after completing the Operation Analytics.

The project is implemented with the help of Exponential Smoothing to forecast the daily vaccines to be administered in July in India.
Further improvements can be done by tweaking the paramertes and also using advanced Forecasting Techniques.

The dataset is used from Kaggle.https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress 

Further information about Exponential Smoothing can be looked from this link. https://machinelearningmastery.com/exponential-smoothing-for-time-series-forecasting-in-python/
